        <h3>MARKETING</h3>
        <p>Those who are smart about marketing understand that using traditional marketing methods isn’t very effective and overall, appears to be on the decline. As a result, there are other ways to market, in this particular case, content marketing.</p>

      <p>As you may already know or have already predicted, many consumers are shying away from the traditional world of marketing. Many utilize DVRs to skip television adds, print has been long known as a dying industry and many have turned to “surfing the web” as they can take in information without having to worry about banners or buttons that can make their experience irrelevant.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="cus-red">SO WHAT EXACTLY IS CONTENT MARKETING?</h2>
      <p>The Answer: Content marketing is a strategic approach that is centered around creating and distributing valuable and relevant content to attract and retain a very specifically-targeted audience. The ultimate goal with content marketing (or any type of marketing) really is to drive profitable customer action.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The purpose of content marketing is to attract and retain customers by creating and curating relevant and valuable content with the intention of changing or improving consumer behavior. Generally speaking, content marketing is an ongoing process that is typically used as an integrated form of marketing in your overall marketing strategy. The focus in content marketing unlike advertising is to own the media as opposed to renting it. You should note that you should not be pitching your products or services in your content marketing efforts all the time. Depending on your overall marketing strategies, you may want to stick to an 80/20 rule where 80% of the time you are providing value to your customer in the form of information, instructions and/or general knowledge while 20% of the time you can try to pitch a product or service that may be helpful to them.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="cus-red">AN INTEGRATED FORM OF MARKETING THAT IS HERE TO STAY</h2>
      <p>What makes content marketing a long-lasting integrated form of marketing is the fact that you aren’t constantly pitching something to your audience. If all you do is try to pitch your products or services to your clients, you aren’t really bringing them much value. Good content marketing makes a person take action and read everything being said, think about it and take action on it. If they gained something of value from your site and you are consistently putting out content, they will be back for more, share your efforts with others, which help you spread the word, and perhaps they will even buy or recommend your products or services for you.</p>

      <h2 class="cus-red">HOW FLARE CAN HELP YOU WITH YOUR CONTENT MARKETING</h2>
      <p>First and foremost, each business has their own quirks and no two strategies are exactly alike. We start off by examining the current state your business/brand is in and compare it to that of your competition.  The next step is to understand the state of our existing content marketing efforts (if any).</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have an existing editorial team, we can assess their work, establish areas of improvement and train them on best practices that will help show you results from your efforts.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you don’t have an existing editorial team, you can hire us directly to brainstorm, create and manage your content marketing efforts. In this scenario, we’d obviously love to work closely with you or one of your staff members or are more than capable of taking a more hands-on approach if you would prefer to leave it up to us to help you establish a voice, write content, and grow the traffic to your site.</li>
