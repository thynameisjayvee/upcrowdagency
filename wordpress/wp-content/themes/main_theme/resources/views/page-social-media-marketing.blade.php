      <p>Social media appears to be the game changer for businesses in various industries as companies have the ability to reach out and communicate on a personal level with their target audience on a daily basis. For businesses who engage in marketing, sales, customer service and other businesses activities, social media adds a new layer to the mix that was previously unavailable via traditional marketing. Furthermore, the success gap appears to be widening as businesses use social media in an informal, ad hoc manner and those who are taking a more planned and strategic approach.</p>
