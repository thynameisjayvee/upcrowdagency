      <h2 class="cus-red">RAISE YOUR WEBSITE RANKINGS FOR VARIOUS SEARCH RESULTS WITH AN EFFECTIVE SEO CAMPAIGN</h2>
      <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the visibility of a website or webpage in a search engine’s “organic” or unpaid results section. The leading search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing rank sites based on a business’s proximity to the user or searcher as well as the website’s content, images, videos and inbound links. These factors all play a role in your website’s placement in the search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
      <br>
      <p>SEO as a whole is often segmented into two categories: on-page SEO and off-page SEO.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="cus-red">ON-PAGE SEO AND OFF-PAGE SEO</h2>
      <p>On-page SEO includes everything that can be edited and optimized on a website itself. This includes having appropriately structured navigation menus, a proper URL structure, good usage of headings and page structure among other factors. Off-page SEO on the other hand encompasses all elements that factor into a search engine’s algorithm. These are typically external factors such as business reviews, relevant inbound links to your website, a social media presence and more.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The majority of an SEO campaign’s success is based on off-page factors but the on-page SEO elements are the foundation of the campaign and must be addressed.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="cus-red">ON-PAGE SEO</h2>
      <p>On-page optimization is the process of structuring and creating website content in order to be as relevant and as valuable as possible. By doing this, search engines will be able to effectively connect you with your audience and potential customers. On-page optimization is primarily utilized to guide “search bots” or “spiders” across your website. These search bots are employed by search engines to evaluate, index and rank your websites throughout the web. If your website wasn’t built and optimized according to these search bots as well as human visitors, it’s likely that search engines won’t properly recognize your website, which will affect your ability to reach your customers.</p>

      <p>Keyword Density</p>
      <p>Internal Website Linking</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="cus-red">OFF-PAGE SEO</h2>
      <h4>The Process of Setting Up a Successful SEO Campaign</h4>
      <p>First and foremost, it should be noted that a proper SEO campaign takes time to come to fruition. It takes time and effort to design, code and optimize a great website to rank in the top results of a search engine. SEO experts and those with knowledge and experience are usually able to provide your website greater visibility than a novice marketer could have achieved on their own. That’s where we come in and can be of help.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our marketing team helps businesses and website’s rank in two particular ways: Organic SEO and Local SEO.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="cus-red">ORGANIC SEO</h2>
      <p>Organic search engine optimization refers to getting your website ranked competitively for an online search without paying for search engine placement. You can imagine that the higher ranked websites will likely get clicked on by search engine users more often and as a result bring more people into their sales funnel which will ultimately lead to more business.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Organic SEO is the process of “organically” improving the visibility of a website in the leading search engines (Google, Yahoo! and Bing). To be successful, your website needs to have relevant content laid out in a structure that’s easy to navigate. Having useful and important content is a very important factor, one which is developed continually with targeted keywords and relevant phrases to help improve your organic search engine rankings. This makes it easier for prospective customers interested in your products or services to find you online. Improving your website rankings as you can imagine is one of the best ways to generate traffic to your website.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Why exactly is an organic SEO campaign helpful?</h4>
      <p>Organic search engine optimization helps your business rank naturally through various online searches without having to pay for search engine placement. As a result, it helps ensure more people and potential customers find your website by helping your website rank effectively on the list of search results. As you can imagine, websites that are on the top of the list are more likely to be clicked on. Some businesses pay to to have their websites appear at the top of search results but many don’t trust sites that are listed in Google’s ad section at the top of the search results page. Many users tend to move toward the links that appear organically since it’s more likely that it will have relevant content related to their search results.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>SO HOW EXACTLY DO WE HELP?</h4>
      <p>Our goal is to make sure that your business’ keyword rankings are prominent in search results. The first task is to raise your rankings and the second is to maintain them once we get them to where we want to be. Our specialists work to consistently identify keywords and generate a strategy custom to your business’ needs in order to improve your rankings and then maintain them, resulting in more traffic and ultimately more business.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>ORGANIC SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION IS AN EFFECTIVE TRAFFIC GENERATING METHOD</h4>
      <p>Typically when business owners compete for a spot on the first page of search engine results, many choose to pay for ads. The ads usually come in the form of pay-per-click placements and business owners usually pay each time a visitor clicks on their ad(s). As you can imagine or may already know, this can get quite expensive very fast. Alternatively, using organic SEO, your website will begin to rank naturally and it’s placement in the organic search engine results section increases your business’ validity in the eyes of users.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="cus-red">LOCAL SEO</h2>
      <p>In its attempt to make search engine results more relevant to its users, Google has ranked local businesses in a separate category on its first page. It does this even above other national results which appear. Now, when users enter a service-related search query, they’re being connected with the most relevant business. With an effective SEO campaign, this business could be yours.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Every day, many people search for local services and products on Google. They do this on both computers and on mobile devices alike. When searching, they are usually looking for the right service, store or restaurant. The real question here should be are they finding your business? Does your business stand out from the rest?</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our local SEO services can help you improve your rank in the “local map results” section which can be found at the top of Google results pages for relevant search terms. We can help boost your business’ ranking with optimized content and citations.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>IS IT EXPENSIVE?</h4>
      <p>Typically we charge an initial setup fee to build your local business listing and going forward a reasonable monthly fee to continually optimize your business listing in order to both increase and maintain your rank/position and therefore ultimately exposure.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you’re looking to get first page local SEO results, our services are right for you. Your business listing will also ensure that your business will appear on Google maps, which is used by a range of websites and provides navigation on an increasing number of mobile devices in today’s world.</p>
