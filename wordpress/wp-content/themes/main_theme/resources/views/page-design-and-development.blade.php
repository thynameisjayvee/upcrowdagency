        <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <h3>AND DESIGN</h3>
        <p>Website design is one of the most important components of an online brand. In today’s day and age, having a website is a necessity for many businesses.</p>

      <p> It serves as the home base to several other marketing efforts such as social media, search engine optimization, pay-per-click campaigns, etc. This is exactly what having a user friendly website design plays an important role when it comes to reducing your bounce rate, improving conversion and attracting clients that will help your business succeed. Our experienced team of website designers take your projects and your goals seriously in order to help create the perfect design.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our designers have the ability to provide artistic and affordable solutions for a wide variety of projects. Whether you’re looking to redesign your whole website or something a bit smaller, feel free to reach out and inquire about how we can be of help</p>
      <br>
      <p>When it comes to websites, we prefer to utilize a content management system that will allow you to maintain your website (or let us maintain it for you) in an easy-to-use manner. Our content management system of choice is WordPress and for e-Commerce we tend to stick with Magento.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>THE DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
      <p>The design process is mainly broken into three phases: The Creative Process, The Design Phase, The Development Phase.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Creative Process is where we discuss various aspects of what you are looking for. This includes (but isn’t limited to) your color preferences, type of imagery, the tone you’re looking for, etc. We’ll establish the goals for the project allowing us to provide creative direction and share ideas for you to approve.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After going back and forth, establishing the design direction and having the approval to move forward we enter the design phase. In the design phase we bring the idea to life by giving you mockups or a test website that incorporates all of the ideas. This will allow you to get a better idea of what the finalized product may look like. You’ll also have the opportunity to provide feedback and request any changes you see fit.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Once the design is approved we move on to developing the site. We prefer to develop on easy-to-use and maintain content management systems such as WordPress and Magento. The backend infrastructure to the sites we make are clean, easy-to-use and manage. We can even help set up infrastructure for analytics and other processes so you can remain organized and informed.</p>
