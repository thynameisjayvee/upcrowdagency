          <h6>DRIP EMAIL CAMPAIGNS</h6>
          <p>Sometimes, timing really is really everything. The “drip” campaigns deliver the right email at a strategic time: exactly when your prospect is likely to take action.</p>

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <h6>RE-ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGNS</h6>
          <p>You likely lose many subscribers every year due to inactivity alone. You can try to recapture the interest of this tricky audience segment, earning back the attention of subscribers you never meant to let go.</p>
